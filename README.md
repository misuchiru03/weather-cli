# This is a short script that grabs the weather from whatever
# [city, ST] or zip code you input as an argument and print
# the weather forecast in the command line.
# If no city is entered, it goes by the city given in the
# script itself.  You may enter your own city or zip code
# in the city variable for default, so no city is required
# when entering the command.
#
#
# USE:
# weather Los Angeles, CA
## This will produce the weather forecast for LA
#
# weather 60290
## This will produce the weather forecast for the zip code 60290 (Chicago)
#
# weather
## This will look into the script itself for the city or zip code
## that will become the default location for the weather forecast.
