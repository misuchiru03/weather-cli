Weather is a script that curls from wttr.in in an attempt to pull your requested city's weather forecast all from command line.  The script will allow for an IP, a city and state, or zip/postal code to be entered after the command [weather sacramento, ca, weather 01902, or weather 76.99.120.110 will result in weather for each respective area].  If no location information is entered after the command, then it polls your public IP address, performs a query of your IP address's city, state, and zip code and uses that information for its forecast query.

BUGS:
+Currently, only US and Canada zip/postal codes are accepted.  This is based on wttr.io capability of searching based on postal code.  The result of using a zip or postal code from other than US or Canada is "ERROR" and exit.
+There is also an issue performing this while using a VPN connection or SSH Tunnels or Socks Proxy. The public IP address of the VPN server will be used to base location. +Lastly that I have found is when using mobile net connections/tethering, you will require a location. The IP address does not equate to a location, so you will receive a forecast for St. Petersburg, RU.  NOTE: The IP address you associate with your city may not actually be owned by a company in your city.  IP addresses have been found to point to a completely different city/state.  Best to use your own city, state as opposed to an IP address.
