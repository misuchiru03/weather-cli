This is a short script that grabs the weather from whatever
[city, ST] or zip code you input as an argument and print
the weather forecast in the command line.
If no city is entered, it goes by the city given in the
script itself.  You may enter your own city or zip code
in the city variable for default, so no city is required
when entering the command.
